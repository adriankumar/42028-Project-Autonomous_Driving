## Updates
* `gui_v3` now has real-time model visualisation
* speed calculations/visualisations are now toggleable to prevent over-head calculations during live inference and initial set up of the GUI

# ðŸš— Project Overview
This project implements a **Level 2 autonomous driving system** using a novel hybrid architecture combining CNNs with Liquid Time-Constant (LTC) cells for highway driving assistance. Our lightweight model processes video frames and vehicle telemetry to predict steering angles and acceleration in real-time. 


- ðŸ“„ [Full Project/Assignment Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mZLEZwRek-2oWJMrC03CmJ7OBZdEgZl2rhWGWmrzpeE/edit?usp=sharing) - Contains detailed architecture diagrams, experimental results, and comprehensive analysis.


# ðŸ“Š Dataset
## Comma.ai Dataset

- **Download**:  https://archive.org/details/comma-dataset
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/commaai/research/tree/master
- **Size**: ~75GB video data (11 driving videos)
- **Format**: H5 files containing video frames and telemetry
- **Features**:
     - **Input**: *Video frames (160Ã—320Ã—3)* + *speed_abs*;
    - **Targets**: *steering_angle*, *car_accel*



# ðŸ§  Model Architecture
Our model explores the implementation of LTC Networks [1,2], specifically the WormNet Architecture which was the original [Convolution + LTC cell hybrid](https://github.com/mlech26l/keras-ncp) framework for autonomous steering *[See Video here](https://youtu.be/IlliqYiRhMU?=I1ow4FDprk-BhDM2)*. Our implementation provides the pytorch version for steering and acceleration, with modifications to the architecture for our current dataset; We may potentiallly scale the autonomy level in the future. The full architecture contains:

- **Convolutional Head**: 6-layer CNN for visual feature extraction (48 feature output)
- **Speed Embedding**: 8-dimensional speed feature representation
- **LTC Cell**: 98 neurons (56 sensory, 24 inter, 12 command, 2 motor)
